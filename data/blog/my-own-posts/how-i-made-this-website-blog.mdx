This blog was made using the "Tailwind CSS Blog" template from Vercel.

I was trying to make a blog and add it to an already made website, but I don't like the workflow
needed to make them work, so after a lot of struggles I decided to start all over and make a new website
with the blog included. I also tried some templates with a CMS included, like Sanity, Contentful and Prismic, but
I struggled to change the theming, the main page or the links in the navigation bar.

At the end I found the template that I already mentioned, and even though it doesn't include a CMS, I liked it
because it is way easier to modify, which is what I did.

It has a lot of features, which you can read [here](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog),
being the most important for me: the use of Tailwind, the use of MDX for the blog posts, math display with "KaTeX" and
the structure, which is easy to use.

I installed it using the next code:
```bash
npx degit https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git
```
The instructions in the template site are very clear, so I won't talk about them but I'll mention some things that I
have to remember for my own use, like the `npm run dev` command to run the development server, `node ./scripts/compose.js`
to bootstrap a new post (you have to fill some data and it'll create a new file within the 'data' folder).

I replaced the favicons with a simple one made with [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) (it's text based).
I made the main page using a hero from DaisiUI, and the typing animation comes
from [React-type-animation](https://github.com/maxeth/react-type-animation). The template includes a section to show
the last posts in the main page, but I disabled it because I don't liked to have posts in the main page.


The icons from the main page come from [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

I had some issues when building the site, so I followed the instructions from the terminal and fixed them before deployment.

I uploaded the project to github, and also it is important to remember that in order to add a new post or modify my site
I have to push the new content into the repository, which I can do with the next sequence of bash commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit"
git push -u origin main
```

I know it's nothing very fancy, but I'm not so used to github.

I still want to change some stuff like the theme, pick a better image at the main page and keep making posts for my blog.
