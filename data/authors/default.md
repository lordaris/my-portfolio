I'm an enthusiast programmer.
I'm also an enthusiast learner, kinda addicted to learn new skills.

I think that I can be a very valuable employee because even if I don't know how to do something at the time, I consider myself a very good learner, and I'll learn as much as I can to be the best at any job.

I'm a music composer, piano player, music producer, a gym instructor, music teacher, entrepreneur (I had a School and I have a plant business, which I open from February to June).
I learned English as a second language and I like to take courses from time to time, which you can see in my LinkedIn account.
